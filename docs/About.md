# About


I obtained my PhD on November 2019 at the University of Barcelona under the supervision of Luis Dieulefat and Rosa Maria Mir√≥-Roig.

## Current occupation

I work as a Firmware Developer at PickData, Circontrol corporate group.  

I am also part-time lecturer at the Universitat de Lleida.


[Here](http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/145377) is my thesis.

## Research interests
My research interests include:

- Galois theory (inverse Galois problems and geometric Galois representations)

- Diophantine Geometry (Fermat-type equations).

- I also enjoy non-commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry and Topology problems.

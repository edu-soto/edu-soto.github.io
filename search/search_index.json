Current occupation I work as a Firmware Developer at PickData, Circontrol corporate group. I am also part-time lecturer at the Universitat de Lleida. Here is my thesis. Research interests My research interests include: Galois theory (inverse Galois problems and geometric Galois representations) Diophantine Geometry (Fermat-type equations). I also enjoy non-commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry and Topology problems.","title":"About"},{"location":"About/#about","text":"I obtained my PhD on November 2019 at the University of Barcelona under the supervision of Luis Dieulefat and Rosa Maria Mir\u00f3-Roig.","title":"About"},{"location":"About/#current-occupation","text":"I work as a Firmware Developer at PickData, Circontrol corporate group.
